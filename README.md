# look2social_spamfilter

Business Understanding:

Look2Social is a social media analysis platform which collects data of its client’s products and services from social media, compares with competitors and provides strategies to match emerging market trends.
However, there are numerous “spam” posts on social media nowadays. Many companies use social media as their marketing tool and some products post an automatic message on users’ social media[screenshot]. These spam posts do not convey any beneficial insight to analysis - they just increase the volume of social media posts to interpret and possibly affect some categories which are related to quantitative analysis.
The current data collection tool of Look2Social cannot filter out spam messages. Therefore, the algorithm to filter spam messages would be highly valuable as it would contribute to the improvement of accuracy and efficiency of look2social’s service to its clients.
